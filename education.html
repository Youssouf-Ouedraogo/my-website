        <h3>Yargo-Yarce</h3>
        <p>
          I went to the Elementary school of Yargo-Yarce. My First grade teacher name is Mr. Christopher.
          My Second Grade teacher name is Mr Yacouba Sawadogo. Mr Eloi Ouedraogo is my third grade teacher.
          Mme Sawadogo is my Fourth grade teacher and my sixth grade teacher is Mr. Issaka Sawadogo.
          I got my CEP (Elementary School Certicate in Yargo-Yarce. In Burkina Faso there is a national exam that
          every student has to passed in order to go to Junior High School).

        <p>After my elementary school studies in Yargo Yarce, I attended my Junior High of Mane at Lycée Departemental de Mané.
          When I first started it was <strong>CEG de Mané</strong>.
          However, by the time I finish, there was an upgrade and instead of having just Junior High School, we had both the Junior High School and High School at the same place now.
          At the end of my Junior High School, once again I had to passed a national exam to go to High School.
          I got my BEPC, the diploma at the end of Junior High, at the Lycée Departemental de Mané. In Burkina Faso at the end of Junior High School students have to decide
          wether they want to study Literature or Science. I wanted to study Science but there still was not a Science branch in my school since it newly became a High School.
          So I studied Literature. That is when I was exposed to philosophy and intensive writing. Our exams were mostly four hours.
          I graduated from High School with a degree in Literature and Philosophy. Once again I got my diploma after passing a national exam.
          The next step was the university. I applied to be a History and Archeology  at the University of Koudougou (Université Norbert-Zongo).
          I was admitted but never went back for the classes. I also applied to be an English Major at the University of Ouagadougou (UO; Université de Ouagadougou).
          I started taking English classes at the University of Ouagadougou but then I got the opportunity to come to study to the US.

        <p>
          When I got the US in May 2016, I barely spoke English. So, I had to learn English first. My host family that is sponsoring me suggested that I wen to Felician because
          they have a good ESL (English as a Second Language) program. My first day at a computer lab at I printed around 100 pages of a document because I had no idea what I was doing.
           By January I was ready to start with my University classes. My host family, told me that since I am entering
          in a new education system I should first go to a community college instead of a four years institution. I later on understood that the academic
          expectation at a community college is lower compare to the academic expectation of four years institutions. So, went to Northampton Community College.

        <h3>Northampton Community College</h3>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.northampton.edu/Resources/Images/nccDiamond.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The reason I went to Northampton Community College (NCC) was because it was one of the few community colloges that have dorms.
            Since I studied literature in High School I started out as a Political Science Student. For my first semester I did not take any science of math class.
            The the summer however, I took Precalculs, Introduction Computers and Applications at Rutgers University as a visiting student. The reason I took those classes
            at Rutgers was to have a taste of educational level at a four years institution. I went back to NCC for the normal semester. After those classes,
            I change my interest into science once again. Even though my Computer Science class was challeging I learned a from it since I got to learned more about
            software we use on regular basis as well as little bit of coding. So, I read a book called <strong>Software (Understanding computers)</strong> to learn more about the usage of coding.
            So when I went back to NCC, I took more Computer Science classes I decided to change my major from Political Science to Computer Science.
            While I was at Northampton Community I was a student athlete. I ran cross country. I was also a member of Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society.
            I did not wait to get my associate before I transferred to Rutgers University.

        <h3>Rutgers University</h3>
        <img src="https://www.lv-em.com/web/image/1763" alt="Rutgers' logo">
        <p>
          Before I official became a Rutgers student. I clearly had my major. My major is computer science now.
          So, my main focus was to finish my requirements to get my Bachelor in Science as a Computer Science major.
          After my first semster however, I became a transfer. My role was to work with transfer deans to help new
          transfer students to adjust well at Rutgers by walking them through the resources the university has to offer.
          After my first year, I became the  Community Service Chair for BMC (Black Male Collective). Because of the coronavirus
          I had to finish my classes online. During the entire time that I have been studying in the US, my host family take cares of expenses and they
          have always been on my side all of the time to help me make good decision. Without their help I would not have come to the US and without their
          guidance when I got to the US I would not have reached where I am.
