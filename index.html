        <span class="about"> I was born and raised in a small village in Burkinka Faso.
    Growing up there, my access to technologies was limited. I, however, was interested and learning how they work. I used my dad phone to learn how to use a phone.
    I was able to learn to the point that people would come to see because they were having some issues with their phones.
    After graduating high school, I got the opportunity to come to study in the US where technology is a big thing. It was like living the dream.
    So, I decided to challenge myself to take a computer science class. I then read a book called Software in which learned more about how software impact peopleâ€™s lives on a daily basis.
    I realized that computer science was not just about learning how computers work but also how to use them to solve problems.
    So, I decided to major in computer science and learn more about how to use computers to solve problems.
    Now I was able to solve a problem using computers by building an educational app that shares the legacy of one of the
    presidents of Burkina Faso who was a great leader but is known by a lot of people which you can download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youssouf.thomassankara" target="_blank">here</a>.
    Currently I am looking to combine my passion for Software development and my ability to work as part of a team or individual if need be to get a job as a Software Developer. You can see my resume <a href="Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

    As far as my future goals are concerned, In 2 to 3 years, I would like to have mastered the main languages and framework of my future company and know how to make them perform as efficiently as possible.
    To do this, I would like to have gone through several team-based development cycles, experience scaling issues with different architectures and frameworks
    and have worked out how to solve them as part of a team doing the development. From there I will see where my next step would be.

        <h3>RU Parking(Android Studio, Java, NoSql, Firebase) </h3>
        <p>Student at Rutgers University have issues knowing when and where
           they can park with their parking permit. So, I decided to research on the problem. I conducted both online and in person interviews.
           I realized that the problem was common among students who park on campus. So, I conducted another vage of survey on the features
           that would be useful to them. Based on the results of those surveys, I built a mobile app only list the parking lots they are allow to park
           on at any point in time of the day. I also implemented a waze like system to allow them to report parking availibity to other users.
           Using google Map Api, I included maps of the parking lots so that students can easily drive to their locations.
           you can find the app on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manoideveloppers.myapplication">Google Play</a>.
           I am however still working on the iOS version of the app.

        <h3>Facial and digit recognition(Python, Pycharm)</h3>
        <p>This was a team base project. the goal was to use machine learning to tell wether
           a given picture was a photo or not or wether it is a digit or not.
          I was working in a group of 3 people. I solved the problem by implementing a percepton and the
          mira algorithm. For the both algorithm I just had a vector holding the features and the weight of
          each feature. The score is the dot product of feature vector and the weight vector.
          the equation of the predicted label is:
          <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc5b83e57ad0de11c737317732783fcf03b8cf1b" alt="percepton predicted label">
          if our prediction is right, we pass to the next training image. On the other hand if our prediction is wrong the adjust the weight. The way we
          adjust the weight is the only difference between the percepton and the mira algorithm. For the percepton, I adjust the weight as following:</p>

          </div>
          <p>increase the weight of label that was supposed to predict the right label by its feature and decrease the weight
             of the label that made the wrong prediction by its feature. For the Mira, in case of a wrong prediction the weight is adjust as following:</p>

        <h3>A* Algorithm Implementation(Python, Pycharm)</h3>
        <p>Given a maze, a starting point and a goal, find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal.
          I achieved that using repeated forward A* and repeated backward A*. Both are the same except their execution. for
          repeated forward A* the robot will learn the wall as it goes. However, for repeated backward A*, the robot has
          the full path before moving. A* works as the following: we compute the shortest path from where we are
           to our destination. Without taking into account the walls we have not encounter. We start following the path until we hit a wall.
           We add that wall in our list of walls. we compute the shortest path where we are standing now to our destination. This time
           however, we eliminate the possibility of passing through the wall. We repeat this process until we get to our goal just like with the animation below

        <h3>Educational App(Android Studio, Java)</h3>
        <p> Thomas Sankara was an examplary leader of Burkina Faso.
          However he is not known but lot of people So I decided to build a mobile app to promote his leacy.
          I did my research first, then translate my research into French and English, designed the features and implemented
          those feature. After a series of testing, I publish the app on Google Play and it current has over 10,000 downloads.
          you can download the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youssouf.thomassankara">on google play</a> as well.

        <h3>Huffman Encoding, decoding(X2go, C)</h3>
        <p>Given a file I had to convert it to 1s and 0s and store it in a file.
           When I take those 1s and 0s file, I should be able to convert it to the original text.
          To do so. I created an intermediate codebook file. That file contains all of the words with their corresponding 1s and 0s patterns.
          Once I have that intermediate codebook, it became easy to go back and forth between the encoded file and the original.
          To get the intermediate file, I used Huffman tree. You can download the full code from my github <a href="https://github.com/Youssouf-Ouedraogo/Huffman_Encoding">here</a>
