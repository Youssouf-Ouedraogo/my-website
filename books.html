        <h3>Software (Understanding computers)</h3>

        <p>I have to start with this book. It is the book that inspired me to major in computer science. Before I took my first
          computer science class which was Introduction to Computers and Application, I had no idea what coding or programming even was.
          When I took the class my goal was to be able to learn commonly used applications to help me navigate through college.
          We touch on some <strong>Scratch</strong>. It was really confusing at the begining but as time went, I started picking up.
          By the end of the semester I became pretty good with Scratch. However, I was still confused about the usefulness of programming
          and coding. So, I read this book. It talks about the evolution of computer hardware and software throughout history. It also talks
          about the daily usage of software in our daily lives. That gave me a clearer idea to what I was. So, I decided to take a coding class.
          That is how I became a Computer Science Major. If I had not read this book, I would not have probably built this website myself.

        <h3>The African Origin of Civilization, Myth Or Reality BY Cheikh Anta Diop</h3>

        <p>
          I read book as part of my reading list for my Introduction to African Civilization taught by professor kamau kenyatta during my first
          semester in college. As the title suggested it talks about the contribution to black people throughout history. The part that interested
          me more was where he talks about black people being at the origin of the Egyptian Civilization. Prior to read this book I always believed
          that the Arabs were at the origin of Civilization. From there I realized that racist comments, that will never put on my website,
          about the contribution of Africans to Civilization were just based on bigotry, ignorance and hate to black people.This shaped how I viewed
          myself as African and how I view other Africans.

        <h3>Le Parachutage By Norbert Zongo</h3>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ana96KY.jpg" alt="book image">
        <p>
          Le Parachutage was by the Burkinabe writer Henri Segbo, using his pseudonym Norber Zongo.
          In his book he describes a functional character whose name is Gouama. He was a corrupt, cruel ruler
          of Watinbow. In the story, he ended up being overthrown and he paid the price of his actions at the end of the book.
          I was still in High school when I read the book and learned that we have to be careful with the actions we take
          because the power and the motivations that we have to take some actions are temporarily. The consequenses of our actions
          on the other hand will always comback to us whether they are positive or negative.
