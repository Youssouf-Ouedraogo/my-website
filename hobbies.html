          <h3>Mobile Development</h3>
          <p>When I took object-oriented programming in spring 2018, my professor said that if we had time at the end of
          the semester, we would have done Mobile development. Unfortunetaly we did not have time to do so. A friend of mine
          Emmanuel Yoan helped me install and set up Android studio, which is a software development environment
          for android phones. Since after that, I watch lot youtube videos and taught myself android development. I enjoy doing
          and really like that I can develop an app that play with it on my phone. As I got better I build a mobile app to
          promote the legacy of Thomas Sankara. you can <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youssouf.thomassankara">clik here </a> to download the app.
          I then made an app to ease Rutgers student parking experience. You can also find that app  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manoideveloppers.myapplication">here</a>.
          The only motivation I had building those apps are just that it was something fun to do for me. I am currently learning iOS Development in order to have iOS versions of my apps.

          <h3>Triple Jump</h3>
          <p>Often time when people ask me about my hobbies I reply by saying
            that I enjoy playing soccer. That is true. However my favorite sport is <strong>Triple Jump</strong>
            It is a sport that a play back in Junior High schoool and high school in my EP class. Since it requires a special terrain like
            long jump, it is hard to find a place to practice it and it. Also, there are not as much small competitions as other sports like
            soccer or cross country. That makes it hard to practice. I do not remember exactly my personal record for triple jump but it is around
            10.3 meters which is about 33.8 feet. This is a record a set back in High school. After high school did not get a chance to practice it again
            Here is a short video of Triple jump if you are not familiar with the sport.

          <h3>Football not American Football but real football (Soccer)</h3>
          <img class="soccer" src="https://i.imgur.com/0Iblr0Z.jpg" alt="At the soccer field">
          <p>Although I have not played any major soccer competition I really like playing it. I would say that my level is intermediate
             but I have fun playing it which is what mostly matter when it comes to hobbies. When I was in Burkina Faso,
             Since the weather is always nice there we can play any season of the year. When I move to the US
             however, I mainly play over the summer. I played the Rutgers intermurals for Tiki-Taka FC.
             I played as back-right. Since, I had good stamina I would run up and down to support both the defense and the offense.
             That was something my team expected from me. Our team was
             really good. We played to consecutive finals but we lost both of them unfortunetaly.
             What was even frustrating for those losses is that for the entire seasons the only time we lost was on the finals.
             However, at the end of the day it was fun to get off the electronics and play with others.

          <h3>Long Distance running</h3>
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9NbcInD.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Long distance running is not a common sport in Burkina Faso at least for where I grew up. From what I can remember
            the longest time I hard to run in high school was 12 minutes. For the national exams endurance running is 1.5 kilometers
            which is about a mile which I runned around 5.5 minutes. When I moved to the US. I realized that soccer is not a common
            sport as in Burkina Faso. That why and when I got interested in long distance running. Initially, I would just go out for
            a 2 to 3 mile (3 to 5 km) run. For my last semester at Northampton Community College, I joined the cross country team. Initially it was hard to
            keep up. With time I was able to better myself and I would go out for a 7 to 10 miles (11 to 16 km). For the competitions, we
            only competed a 3.15 miles (5 km) once the rest of our competition were 5 miles (8 km). My personal record for 3.15 miles is 19 minutes 20 seconds and
            for the 5 miles my personal record is 32 minutes 48 seconds. One main thing I learned about cross country is that is not just a sport
            it is a life philosophy. When I decided I was joining the cross country team, lot of people told me that it was hard. And, yes it is hard
            when I went to the trainings, for the first two miles I started questionning why I was doing this to myself. By the time a realized I am
            already done with the 7 to 10 miles. The same goes with life, when you are trying out something new, lot of people will tell you that is
            hard, and some others will tell you that you will not be able to make it. That is not what mostly matters. What mostly matters is
            your state of mindset to achieving your goals. Do you believe that you can achieve them or will you let the others have reasons over your.
             If you ask my opinion, I would say, <strong>Never let someone fulfill their bad prophecy on you.</strong>
